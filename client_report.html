      <h2>Client Report</h2>
      <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong></p>
      <p>[For the content I decided to give them something fun. My first python program was a phising scam that became an educational tool. For the images/theme i liked the idea of pirates and a scam line]</p>

      <p><strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</strong></p>
      <p>[There were no miscommunications. She was very good at keeping my honest about responding.]</p>

      <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong></p>
      <p>[I really liked how the project turned out, I will definetly save it and use it in the future as a teaching tool.]</p>

      <p><strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</strong></p>
      <p>[I need to be better at communicating. As I said the lead developer was good at reaching out to me, but in the future I should make contact and see how things are progressing]</p>

      <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
      <p><strong>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</strong></p>
      <p>[At the very begging of the project I sent out an email with my name, email address, and phone numbers. I made myself availible for questions and generally let them design it how they wanted  to.]</p>

      <p><strong>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</strong></p>
      <p>[There were no issues, I did have a problem using the pictures he sent me but I ended up either finding replacements on stockphotos or just using the snip tool on the word document.]</p>

      <p><strong>How did you handle publishing your clientâ€™s site and sharing it with the client?</strong></p>
      <p>[Truth be told, not very well. Github is new to me so it was originally difficult to navigate. After going through and publishing my own portfolio site it was much better]</p>

      <p><strong>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</strong></p>
      <p>[I am not a fan of it. I like having a local copy and being able to see immediate changes, instead of having to wait for the newtwork to catch up. Also I realized that the commenting and making detailed explanations of changes is really helpful.]</p>

      <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
      <p><strong>Truth be told I did no do a good job. The very first week the project started my computer fried itself, then started working again, before repeting the process. This is something I should have made immedialty known to my lead developer. This led to major bottlencks down the line for me.  Not having a working laptop makes being an effective programmer very difficult.</strong></p>
      <p>[Your answer]</p>

      <p><strong>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</strong></p>
      <p>I was aware of my expectations, the outlines were pretty simple and easy to follow.</p>

      <p><strong>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</strong></p>
      <p>I did contribute but not in a manner that I am particualrly proud of. I know when I do good work and my junior development sites were not it.</p>

      <p><strong>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</strong></p>
      <p>Only my lack of understanding. Github is hard to navigate for the beginner but the learning curve is steep</p>

      <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
      <p><strong>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</strong></p>
      <p>It wansn't anything pertaining to the class. The first week of the project my computer broke. The following week I had a family reunion in Utah, that kept me away from my desktop, and where I subsequentially recieved covid from my father. It has been a rough last couple of weeks but I am glad to finish somewhat strong. </p>

      <p><strong>What did you enjoy most about this project?</strong></p>
      <p>I liked seeing all of the different ideas that people wanted for websites. It goes to show that there will always be a need for website design.</p>

      <p><strong>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</strong></p>
      <p>I would be more methodical in my planning and make milestone goals for myself. I feel like I would get a head in one aspect and be lagging behind in another, consistancy is what will help me the ebst</p>

      <p><strong>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>Yes and no. I have had plenty of experience in the Marines working with a variety of people. In most situations you can quickly disseminate information and clarify misundersantings. Working remotely is not a pace im used to. I like it when everyone is on the same time table for a project. I mean specifcally hours in a day, it was funny to see commits late in the night when I am normally asleep. </p>
