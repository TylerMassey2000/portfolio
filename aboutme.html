    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/tyler.jpeg" alt="Picture of Tyler Massey" />
    <p>My name is Tyler Massey. After Highscool I enlisted into the Marine Corps. I was trained as a 0631 Network administrator. I was stationed in Okinawa Japan for three years. While there, I was taught junior level hacking by a mentor. Since then I have continued to expand my education in all things security. This includes higher lever TryHackMe labs, amateur locksmithing, and learning about building security.  </p>
    
    <p>I enjoy playing videogames, reading, hiking, and learning about anything new. I know python, html, css, SQL, microsoft and linux CLI, how to program networks.</p>
